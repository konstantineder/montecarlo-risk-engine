## Overview

This project provides a modular, high-performance Monte Carlo framework for **derivative pricing**, **exposure calculation**, and **xVA risk analytics**, built on top of **PyTorch** for CPU acceleration and adjoint algorithmic differentiation (AAD).

The engine supports equity, interest-rate, credit, and hybrid models, along with a wide range of financial products and risk metrics.

## Key Features

### Risk Metrics

- **PV** – Present Value  
- **CE** – Current Exposure  
- **EE / EPE** – (Effective) Expected Exposure  
- **ENE** – Expected Negative Exposure  
- **EEPE** – Effective Expected Positive Exposure  
- **PFE** – Potential Future Exposure  
- **xVA** – currently **CVA**, with extension points for DVA / FVA / MVA / KVA  

Metrics are available at the **product** and **netting-set** level, including collateralized exposure profiles with margin period of risk (MPoR) handling. Where closed-form evaluation is available for a given product/model pair, the engine can also use **analytical metric evaluation** instead of Monte Carlo.

### Sensitivities & AAD

- Efficient, scalable **adjoint algorithmic differentiation (AAD)** via [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)  
- **First- and second-order sensitivities** for supported products, including Hessian-style outputs from `SimulationResults`
- Payoff smoothing using fuzzy-logic techniques to enable AAD for discontinuous payoffs
  (binary options, barrier options, early-exercise structures)
- CPU-ready design for large-scale simulations

### Supported Products

- European equity & bond options  
- Bermudan equity & bond options  
- Bermudan swaptions  
- American options  
- FlexiCalls  
- Asian options  
- Binary options  
- Barrier options  
- Basket / multi-asset options  
- Interest rate swaps  
- Bonds: zero-coupon bonds, coupon bonds, floating-rate notes (FRNs)

### Stochastic Models

- **Equity**
  - Black–Scholes (single-asset)
  - Black–Scholes multi-asset
  - Heston Model
- **Interest Rates**
  - Vasicek
  - Hull–White
- **Commodity models**
  - Schwartz-Two-Factor
- **Credit**
  - Shifted Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (**CIR++**) with bootstrapped hazard curves from CDS spreads
- **Hybrid ModelConfig**
  - Configure multiple models jointly with a correlation structure to simulate hybrid risk factors  
    (e.g. Vasicek interest rates + CIR++ default intensities with wrong-way risk).

## Architecture

- **SimulationController**  
  Orchestrates Monte Carlo simulations, time stepping, and path generation.

- **ModelConfig**  
  Combines one or more stochastic models and an inter-asset correlation matrix.

- **Metrics API**  
  Pluggable interface for defining numerical and analytical metrics (PV, EE, PFE, CVA, …).

- **Exposure & Regression Engine**  
  Supports Longstaff–Schwartz regression for continuation values and exposure estimation.

- **Netting Sets & Collateralization**  
  Aggregates products into netting sets, supports collateralized and uncollateralized exposure calculations,
  and evaluates delayed collateral posting via MPoR-aware timelines.

- **Request/Response Interface**  
  Models expose quantities (discount factors, survival probabilities, forward rates, etc.) via
  a lightweight request abstraction, allowing flexible model coupling.

The design makes it easy to:

- add new models  
- add new products  
- define new metrics  
- extend to further xVA measures

### Collateralized Exposure

Collateralized and uncollateralized exposure profiles can be compared at the netting-set level, including CSA-style delayed collateral effects via MPoR:

### CVA vs Correlation – Payer Interest Rate Swap (WWR)

CVA of a payer interest rate swap as a function of the correlation ρ between the short rate (Vasicek)
and the default intensity (CIR++). Positive correlation between rates and intensity induces **wrong-way risk**, so CVA
**increases** with ρ. Negative correlation generates **right-way risk**. Error bars show Monte Carlo
standard errors.

### Heston Model – Calibration, Pricing, and Sensitivities

The Heston stochastic volatility model is calibrated to equity option data and used for pricing, risk, and convergence analysis.
- Pricing uses the Quadratic–Exponential (QE) scheme of Andersen (2007)
- Fuzzy-logic smoothing is applied at the QE branching threshold to ensure numerical stability and full compatibility with pathwise AAD
- Greeks (Delta, Vega) computed via AAD are validated against analytic finite differences
- Convergence of Euler vs QE is analyzed with Monte Carlo error bars

![QE scheme analytcs (incl. greeks)](docs/img/heston_model_test.png)

The QE scheme with fuzzy branching delivers accurate prices, stable sensitivities, and significantly faster convergence than Euler discretization, while remaining fully differentiable.
